# Introduction (150 Words)

The rapid advancement of deep learning and generative adversarial networks has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic media, commonly known as deepfakes. These AI-generated videos, which seamlessly swap faces or manipulate facial expressions, pose significant challenges to digital media authenticity and trust. As deepfake technology becomes increasingly accessible and sophisticated, the need for reliable detection mechanisms has become critical for maintaining information integrity in journalism, legal proceedings, and social media platforms. Traditional detection methods often struggle with the evolving nature of deepfake generation techniques, necessitating more robust and adaptive approaches. This project addresses these challenges by developing a comprehensive multi-method deepfake detection framework that combines multiple detection strategies to improve accuracy and reliability. By integrating perceptual dissimilarity mapping through MRI-GAN, temporal sequence analysis, and ensemble fusion techniques, the system provides a holistic approach to identifying synthetic media across diverse video conditions and generation methods. The framework aims to serve as a practical tool for content verification and digital forensics applications.
